# Professional Heroku

Heroku is a fantastic tool for provisioning and deploying applications quickly. But there's more to it than `heroku create myapp`. Do you know how to design, monitor, and scale those applications?

In this course we'll build your understandings of the platform architecture, explore tools and concepts to improve your application, and how to bring it all together.

## What You'll Learn

In this training course, you'll use an actual Ruby/Rails application and study:

* How Heroku's architecture affects your application
* The roles of dynos and background workers
* Keeping private credentials private
* Configuring your application for alternative web servers or Ruby versions
* Moving beyond the default Heroku stack with custom buildpacks
* Dangers and mitigation of long-running requests
* Extracting and optimizing background processes
* Automating Continuous Integration (CI) and zero-downtime Continuous Deployment (CD)
* Gracefully handling deployment failure and rollback
* Automatic alerting when application performance degrades
* Automatic database backups remote systems
* Optimizing logging with distributed systems
* How to apply these techniques with your actual applications
