# Professional Heroku

You've felt the excitement of deploying an app to Heroku...

```
$ heroku create my_app
=> blah blah
$ git push heroku master
=> blah blah
$ heroku open
```

## What You'll Learn

But there's so much more than that. In this training course, you'll use an actual Ruby/Rails application and learn:

* How to take advantage of Heroku's environment variables to keep private credentials private
* Moving behind the default Heroku stack
* Implementing multi-threaded web servers to mitigate long-running requests
* Extracting and optimizing background processes
* Automating Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)

## What's In a Class?

This is not "sit back and watch some slides." All Jumpstart Lab courses are hands-on. We'll work with real applications and you're expected to implement these techniques as we go.

The course runs five full days and can accomodate anywhere from 4 to 24 attendees. We'll come to you.

## Who We Are

The course is constructed and taught by our instructional team in collaboration with the developers and experts at Heroku.
