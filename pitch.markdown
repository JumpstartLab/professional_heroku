# Professional Heroku

(( Pitch Video? ))

You've felt the excitement of deploying an app to Heroku...

```
$ heroku create my_app
=> blah blah
$ git push heroku master
=> blah blah
$ heroku open
```

But there's so much more to the platform. In this course we'll build your skills and understandings of the Heroku platform and how to make the most of it.

## What You'll Learn

But there's so much more than that. In this training course, you'll use an actual Ruby/Rails application and learn:

* How to keep private credentials private
* Moving beyond the default Heroku stack
* Implementing multi-threaded web servers to mitigate long-running requests
* Customizing your buildpack
* Zero-downtime deployment
* Automating Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)
* Gracefully handling deployment failure and rollback
* Extracting and optimizing background processes
* Automating database backups to S3 storage

## What's In a Class?

This is not "sit back and watch some slides." All Jumpstart Lab courses are hands-on. We'll work with real applications and you're expected to implement these techniques as we go.

The course runs five full days and can accomodate anywhere from 4 to 24 attendees. We'll come to you.
