# Professional Heroku

Heroku is a fantastic tool for provisioning and deploying applications quickly. But do you know how to design, monitor, and scale those applications?

In this course we'll build your skills and understandings of the Heroku platform, concepts and tools to improve your application for Heroku, and how to bring it all together.

## What You'll Learn

In this training course, you'll use an actual Ruby/Rails application and learn:

* Keeping private credentials private
* Implementing multi-threaded web servers to mitigate long-running requests
* Moving beyond the default Heroku stack with custom buildpacks
* Automating Continuous Integration (CI) and zero-downtime Continuous Deployment (CD)
* Gracefully handling deployment failure and rollback
* Extracting and optimizing background processes
* Automated alerting when application performance degrades
* Automating database backups to S3 storage
* Optimizing logging with distributed systems

## What's In a Class?

This is not "sit back and watch slides" -- all Jumpstart Lab courses are hands-on. We work with real applications and you'll implement these tools and techniques yourself. By the end of the week, you'll have real experience, real skills, and real code to reference.

## Who's this for?

This course is built for teams of experienced developers who feel comfortable with Ruby, Rails, and the fundamentals of deploying web applications.
