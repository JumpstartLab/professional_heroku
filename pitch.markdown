# Professional Heroku

Heroku is a fantastic tool for provisioning and deploying applications quickly. But there's more to it than `heroku create myapp`. Do you know how to design, monitor, and scale those applications?

In this course we'll build your understandings of the platform architecture, explore tools and concepts to improve your application, and how to bring it all together.

## What You'll Learn

In this training course, you'll use an actual Ruby/Rails application and study:

* The Platform: How does Heroku work? How does that architecture affect your process?
* Customizing Deployment: Tweak your tools, stack, and create a repeatable, reliable deployment process
* Designing for Scale: More than turning up the dynos, how do you architect your application to take advantage of the platform?
* When Things Go Wrong: Disaster will happen, here's how you prepare for it.
* Lessons In Context: Explore your problem domain, your application, and find how to apply these concepts

## What's In a Class?

This is not "sit back and watch slides" -- all Jumpstart Lab courses are hands-on. We work with real applications and you'll implement these tools and techniques yourself. By the end of the week, you'll have real experience, real skills, and real code to reference.
